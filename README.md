# Rswag tutorial

The purpose of this repository is to show a basic example
of how to use rswag in your rails apis. At the end of the steps
below you wil have the final project that you can see here. You
really should know at least what swagger (openApi) is. I will try
to explain what I can, but if you have any questions just go to their
[documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/).

# The example

We will create a rest api for a bookstore. It will be really simple,
so we will won't worry about many cool stuff. However, this will give us
the oportunity to grasp yet another concept called TDD. We will create a
simple rest api that will list all the books available! Pretty neat, huh?

## Step-to-Step

### Prerequisites

Have ruby and rails installed. I used docker to create this project, but you could just as easily to the same outside docker.

To run this project locally using docker, just run this:

```bash
DIR_APP=bookstore docker-compose up rails 
```

### Create a new rails api-only project.

```bash
rails new bookstore --api
```

All of the commands below will run inside this new directory (bookstore).

### Install rspec and rswag

Follow the installation process in their repos: [rspec-rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails#installation), [rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag#getting-started).

### Create our first test

As we are doing TDD here, we will start with a test for an endpoint that will return the list of books. We will surely have no book at the start, but it is the easiest way go, and we will find a way to insert books later.

Rswag can generate the base code for us:

```bash
rails generate rspec:swagger BookController
```

This created a file at "spec/requests/book_spec.rb", open it and you
will see almost nothing. It's ok, we will complete it now.

```ruby
    require 'swagger_helper'

    RSpec.describe 'book', type: :request do
    end
```

We are going to clean it a little bit, and add an empty test.
We will read it line by line to understand some basic components before we dive in.

```ruby
    require 'swagger_helper'

    describe 'Books API' do
        path '/books' do
            get 'List all available books' do
                produces 'application/json'
                response '200', 'books listed' do
                    run_test!
                end
            end
        end
    end
```

At the very first line, we import the swagger_helper. This is a config file created by rswag, and creates the basic structure for our swagger.yaml.

What is this swagger.yaml  I'm talking about? Well, it is the document that follows the OpenApi Standards. It is the specifications for your api, the contract between you, the creator, and all your users. It is also possible to create a beautiful Rest Client UI with it. We will talk more about this later.

When rswag creates our swagger.yaml, it grabs the basic structure from the swagger_helper, and joins it with all the small documentations generated by our tests. It's like magic!

Ok, let's continue. We then create a new rspec test, nothing new here, but we add four strange new words here: "path", "get", "produces" and "response". All pretty straighfoward. We have a path (a.k.a the path of our endpoint), and inside of it we can "GET" some "JSON" information. We are also awaiting a response with a 200 code, that means a successful response.


Now that we have the basics working, let's add an validation inside our test.

```ruby
    require 'swagger_helper'

    describe 'Books API' do 
        path '/books' do
            get 'List all available books' do
                produces 'application/json'
                response '200', 'books listed' do
                    schema type: :object,
                    properties: {
                        name: { type: :string },
                        author: { type: :string },
                        price: { type: :integer }
                    },
                    required: ["name"]

                    run_test!
                end
            end
        end
    end
```

By now, you already can ready most of the code. Here, we added the "schema". Let me tell you something, this is the best part of the standard. We define how we want the response in a format that is organized, simple, and concise. Try reading it before I explain it, I'll wait. 

In our schema, we defined that our response will be an object (in json, this means something between curly braces). Inside these curly braces we'll have a name, and an author. Notice that right at the end we say that we want at least the name of the book. 

Now that we have a nice test, let's run it!

![error 1](/images/error_1.png)

Bam! An error! In TDD we trust that the error messages will guide us to the expected behavior. Let's follow the path that it shows us. Ok, so there's no route for... Of Course! We need to create a route before we try to access. Here we would create just the route, and then go creating component by component, but hey, rails is famous by cool generators right? Let's use one of those to create routes, controller, models... However, we don't need to create another redundant request test so we will tell it so.

```bash
rails generate resource book name:string author:string --no-request-specs
```

Well, it created lots of new and exciting stuff. Let's see if our test passes now (don't forget to migrate before):

![error 2](/images/error_2.png)

That's what I'm talking about! A wild new error appears. This means we are moving, and when we make our test pass we'll be confident that our test is indeed doing what it should. You probably noticed another test "Not implemented", that's the model test generated with the resource. Don't worry about it right now.

Let's be good programmers, and do what the error message says.
```ruby
    class BooksController < ApplicationController
        def index
        end
    end
```

But, why are we not implementing it yet?? Well, baby steps young grasshoper, baby steps...

![error 3](/images/error_3.png)

Cool, now we now that we are returning a 204 (no content) code, but we want a 200! Let return something then. 

```ruby
    class BooksController < ApplicationController
        def index
            render json: {}
        end
    end
```

Then we would see this: 

![error 4](/images/error_4.png)

WOW. Now we are talking. We need to return something that is a json, and has at least a name attribute, in other words, our test is telling us what we need to do step by step. How cool is that? 

```ruby
    class BooksController < ApplicationController
        def index
            @books = Book.all()
            render json: @books
        end
    end
```

This gives the following error: 

![error 5](/images/error_5.png)

If you take a closer look at that error message, you will see that it is not understanding what we are returning: an array. I didn't want to show you this before you were ready and more confortable reading error message after error message. The point here is that our test is too simple, and since this is a schema-based test, we are allowed to go a little further.

```ruby
    require 'swagger_helper'

    describe 'Books API' do 
        path '/books' do
            get 'List all available books' do
                produces 'application/json'
                response '200', 'books listed' do
                    schema oneOf: [
                        { type: :array },
                        { type: :object,
                            properties: {
                                name: { type: :string },
                                author: { type: :string },
                            },
                            required: ["name"]}
                    ]

                    run_test!
                end
            end
        end
    end
```

The important part here is the "oneOf" keyword. It allows us to give many schemas to rswag, and if the response is in one of these formats it should be fine. Let's see.

![success 1](/images/success_1.png)

Yay! We did it! Our first endpoint created purely by following error messages. You are a wizard, Harry! 

Wait... What about when we have books, will it work ok too? Only one way to figure it out. Create a file "spec/fixtures/books.yml" and add the following:

```yaml
    tlotr:
        name: The Lord of The Rings - The two Towers
        author: J. R. R. Tolkien

    hp:
        name: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
        author: J.K. Rowling
```

![success 2](/images/success_2.png)

Still golden. But remember, this data is only used for tests.

We know now that our test is working, but it would be great to visualize and interact with our API.

First, go to swagger_helper.rb and alter the default host from "www.example.com" to "localhost:3000", and the url from "https://{defaultHost}" to "http://{defaultHost}". This will make things easier for us.

Next, run this: 

```bash
RAILS_ENV=test rails rswag
```

This will join every part of our tests and the base structure in one file (swagger/v1/swagger.yaml) and update our ui.

It should look like this:

![swagger 1](/images/swagger_1.png) 

Now, start your application if you haven't yet, and go to "http://localhost:3000/api-docs" and you should see an awesome client for your REST API almost for free!

You can interact with your API too. In the case of our only endpoint, an empty array will be returned because we didn't add anything to the development database. Let's add some data to db to see our code in action. But first, take a look around, feel the UI and how it can help you when you have hundreds of endpoints.

![swagger ui 1](/images/swagger_ui_1.gif) 

Let's add some example data. Go to "db/seeds.db" and add the following:

```ruby
Book.create(name: "The Chronicles of Narnia", author: "C. S. Lewis")
Book.create(name: "The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It For Life", author: "Twyla Tharp")
Book.create(name: "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind", author: "Yuval Noah Harari")
```

Then run this: 

```bash
rails db:seed
```

This is much more realistic, right?

![swagger ui 1](/images/swagger_ui_1.png) 

If you want to have this specifications in one place but prefer to use another client, you can get the swagger.yaml from this path: "http://localhost:3000/api-docs/v1/swagger.yaml". Pretty much every rest api client can read this, including Postman.

TODO: Add post endpoint here

We did good together, thanks for reading until here. I hope you learned something new today.

Cheers!
